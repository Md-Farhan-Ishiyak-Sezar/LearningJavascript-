# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository contains the projects and exercises I've completed while learning JavaScript through Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Udemy.

## Course Description
In this course, I've gained a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, functions, control flow, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, and more. I've also applied my knowledge to build real-world projects using modern JavaScript techniques.

## Repository Structure
- Each project or exercise is organized in its own directory, with a clear and concise name.
- The code files are well-documented and include comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section.
- Additional resources, such as images or external libraries, are included where necessary.

## Projects and Exercises
1. [diceGame](link-to-project) - It's DOM Manipulation Project.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Md-Farhan-Ishiyak-Sezar/LearningJavascript-.git`
2. Navigate to the project or exercise directory: `cd project-name` or `cd exercise-name`
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
4. Run the JavaScript code using a browser or a Node.js environment.

Please note that some projects may require additional setup or dependencies. Refer to the project-specific README file for detailed instructions.
